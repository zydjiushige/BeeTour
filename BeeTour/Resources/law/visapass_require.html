				All foreigners need an entry visa.
                <br>
				Individual travellers can apply at any Chinese embassy. The procedure is usually straightforward and takes about a week.
                <br>
				If your visa runs out while in China, it can be extended by the local Public Security Bureau (PSB), the police. However, make sure you visit them before it expires, because you will be fined for overstaying your visa.
                <br>
				A valid passport is required to enter China. China does not allow entrance if the holder's passport expires in under six months; returning home with an expired passport is illegal, and may result in a fine.
                <br>
                It is a good idea to photocopy the page of your passport that contains your photograph, passport number, and other identifying information, along with other important documents such as visas, travel insurance policies, aeroplane tickets,
                and traveller's check serial numbers, in case you lose anything.
