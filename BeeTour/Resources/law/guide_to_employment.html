				<h2>Foreign experts' rights and duties</h2>
				<p>Contracts will be signed when the foreign expert works in China. It will ensure the cooperation between the two parties and protect their rights. Both parties should fulfill the rights and duties, and any problems or disputes should be dealt with according to the contract.
					Foreign experts must obey the Chinese laws and regulations set by the governments at every level while working in China. Cases concerning foreign experts will be handled by the judicial departments and  public  security  organs  concerned,  with  the help of the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs or the local offices of foreign affairs.
					According to the" Civil Lawsuit Law of the People's Republic  of  China",  the  "Administrative  Lawsuit Law of the People's Republic of China" and the "Contract Law", foreign  experts enjoy the  same legal rights and duties as the citizens of the People's Republic of China. If the courts of the concerned foreign expert's country employ restrictions over the rights and duties of the Chinese citizens in their countries, then equivalent restrictions will be employed over these foreign experts in China.
					The rights and interests of foreign experts working in China are protected by the Chinese government. Foreign experts should carry out the agreements and employment contracts, which should provide clear items on foreign experts' insurance, medical care, holidays and other living conditions. If disputes   occur,   the   experts   can   go   to   the arbitration board of foreign experts' contracts or to the local courts.
					The payment of experts' personal income tax should be done according to the tax laws.
                </p><p>
					Foreign experts can enjoy preferential treatment given by the Chinese government and will be praised or awarded for their good performance by the governments at all levels or their host institutions. The highest award is the "FriendshipPrize" given by the Chinese government.
