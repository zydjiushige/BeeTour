				This publication is reproduced with thanks to the Director of the State Administration of Foreign Experts, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, PRC and is an official guide for foreigners working China as consultants, instructors, tutors and for employees of foreign companies with representative offices.<br>
				Some sections have been revised, refer “Guide to employment Nos 1-6” (2002) and must be read in conjunction any other regulations mentioned in the text.<br>
				At the beginning of its foundation, the People's Republic of China started to invite foreign experts for service in technology, management, science and research, education, journalism and publication and other fields. Since China carried out economic
				reform and opening up to the outside world in 1978 more specialists have been invited from abroad. Up to now foreign experts having worked in China have amounted to 740,000 persons/ times. At present the foreign experts work in all China's provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Their service covers the national economy and social development in such fields as industry, agriculture, key projects, education, science and technology, finance, commercial endeavours, public health and sports, press and law.<br>
				These experts have made great contributions to the promotion of Chinese economic construction and social development as well as to the friendship and cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of other countries. The State Bureau of Foreign Experts Affairs of China is sincerely grateful to all the experts who have worked in China.<br>
				Many who hope to work in China and those establishments that mean to recommend personnel, often ask questions concerning work in China. They want to know which departments or units need foreign experts and what type of specialists, how to enter and leave China, what treatment they will receive and what they need to pay attention to while working and living in China. These friends want the concerned departments to offer them guiding materials. This is the reason we have complied this information.<br>
				To make it practicable, we try to give a clear introduction to China and provide the necessary information that the experts will need to know. China is deepening its reform, some adjustments will be made in the regulations concerning experts working in China, we hope that the experts will understand this. Here we acknowledge the support and help of the experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Public Security and the Beijing Administration of Customs.
